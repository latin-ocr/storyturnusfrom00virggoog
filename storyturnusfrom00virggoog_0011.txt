⁵ In making the selectione ior the story of Turnus, the object
has been tc present to the student, in continuone narrative, a
portion oi the laethali of the Aeneid, which might be read
rapidly and with sustained interest. Everything, therefore,
” which has no direct bearing upon the story has been omitted,
even when, as in the episode οἱ Nisus and Euryalus, the passage
itscli is oi great inteiest aud beauty. The briei outlines in
English of the omitted passages are sufficient to preserve the
connection, while the hesdinge in italics serve> to suggest the
Ι contento of theportionstobe read. The aelections should be
’ read consecutively,not only ior the sake of the story, but also
because words are explained only where they first occur.

The book may be found useful for practice in reading at
sight, for reading without translation, and for rapid reading
outside the class without the aid of a dictionary. The latter
method is strongly recommended as retaining many oi the
advantages, without the dangsrs, of sight-translation. Ii the
work thus prepared is discussed carefully in class by the in-
structor, careless translating into incorrcct English and unin-
teHigent reading oi the Latin text will be avoided, while the
student will have exercised his memory and his powers οξ
