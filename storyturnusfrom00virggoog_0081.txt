i'hls Series contains the Latin authors usually read ln American
schools and collegas, and also others well adapted to class·room
use, but not heretoiore published in suitable editions. The several
volumes are prepared by special editors, who aim to revise the
text careiully and to edit it in the most servicsable manner.

Where there are German editions oi unusual merlt, representing
years oi special study under the most favorable circumstances,
these are used, with the consent oi the foreign editor, as a basis
ior the American edition. In this way it is possible to bring out
text-books oi the highest excellence ina comparatively short period
of time.

The editions are oi two kinds, conforming to the different
methods oi studying Latin in our best institutione. Some contain
in the introductione and commentary such a careiul and minute
treatment oi the author’s lile, language, and style as to afiord the
means for a thorough appreciation oi the author and his place in
Latin literature. Others aim merely to assist the student to a good
readIng knowledge oi the author, and have only the text and briei
explanatory notes at the bottom of each page. The latter are
particularly acceptable for sight reading, and ior rapld reading

editions For instance, aiter a class hae read a play or two oi
Plautus and Terence careiully, with special reference to the pecu·
llarities oi style, language, metres, the methods oi presentinga
play, and the like, these editions will be admirably suited ior the
rapld reading oi other plays.

The Series also contains various supplementary works prepared

by competent scholare. Every eflort is made to give the boobt
