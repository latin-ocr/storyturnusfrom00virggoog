INTRODUOTION.

-ΟΟΡ-

To the reader who has followed Aeneas through the first six
books oi Vergil’s poem, from Troy to Carthago, thence to
Sicily, and finally to his landing at Cumae, it need only be said
by way of introduction to the story oi Turnus, that aiter his
return from the lower world, as described in the sixth book of
the Aeneid, Aeneas goes on board his fleet, and, skirting the
shore of Italy, sails northward, landing at last near the mouth
of the Tiber. Here, he hopes, is to be the home which he has
been so long secking. His followers proceed at once to make
an encampment. Aeneas sends messengers to Latinus, the
king oi the country, with overtures oi peace, and at the same
time asks ior the hand oi the king’s daughter, Lavinia, in
marriage. The aged Italian king, recalling an old oraole to the
- effect that his daughter was to wed a foreigner, believes that
Aeneas has come in iulfilment of propheoy, and therefore
receives the messengers kindly and accepts Aeneas’s proposals '
oi peace and alliance.

Turnus, ruler oi the Rutulians and favored suitor oi Lavinia,
is roused to rebellion against this alliance with Aeneas. The
rivalry between Turnus and Aeneas and the vacillating charac-
ter οἱ Latinus soon bring on a war. The poet invokes the
muse anew to sing oi the mighty struggle between Turnus
and Aeneas, the former fighting in seli-defenoe and to keep
out a foreign invader, while the latter is eager to find a home
and found a kingdom aiter his long years oi fruitless
wandering.
